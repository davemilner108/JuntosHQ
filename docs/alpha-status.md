## What Is Partially Done

### Subscription Tiers & Limit Enforcement

The **data model** records per-junto tier values (`JuntoTier.FREE / SUBSCRIPTION / EXPANDED`) and derives meeting-visibility and commitment-slot limits from them. However, the tier is stored on the **`Junto` row**, not on the **`User`** account. This means:

- There is no `User.subscription_tier` or `User.subscription_status` field.
- The junto-creation gate is **absent** — any signed-in user can create unlimited juntos.
- The feature docs describe enforcement at the user level (e.g., "you've reached your plan's junto limit"). That logic has no backing data.

Meeting-visibility limits (free = 1, standard = 3, expanded = 5) *are* applied on the show page and in the meetings blueprint, but they rely on `junto.tier` which defaults to `FREE` for every new junto. The numbers in the code also diverge from the feature docs (docs say free = last 3 meetings; code enforces 1).

### Pricing Page — Dead Links

Four links on the pricing page (`/pricing`) point to routes that do not exist:

| Link | Problem |
|---|---|
| `Get Started Free → /signup` | No `/signup` route; sign-in is via OAuth at `/auth/login` |
| `Add to any plan → /account/subscription/checkout?addon=chatbot` | No `account` blueprint |
| `Subscribe to Standard → /account/subscription/checkout?plan=standard` | Same — 404 |
| `Subscribe to Expanded → /account/subscription/checkout?plan=expanded` | Same — 404 |

### Stripe / Billing

There is **no payment integration** at all. The pricing page describes three paid tiers and an add-on, but no Stripe checkout, webhook handler, or subscription-management pages exist. For a free-only alpha this is acceptable, but the broken links must be resolved before shipping.

## Remaining Tasks Before Alpha Release

### Must-Fix (Blockers)

1. **Fix pricing page links**
   - Change `Get Started Free` to point to `/auth/login`.
   - Change the three `Subscribe` / `Add to any plan` links to a "coming soon" placeholder (e.g., redirect to `/pricing` with a flash message, or render a waiting-list form).

2. **Add junto-creation limit**
   - Add a free-tier cap (1 junto) in `juntos.new` and `juntos.create`.
   - A user with no subscription should be blocked from creating a second junto, with a clear message linking to `/pricing`.
   - This can be based on `len(g.current_user.juntos)` until a proper `User.subscription_tier` field is introduced.

3. **Add `User.subscription_tier` field**
   - Add a `subscription_tier` column to `User` (enum: `free` / `standard` / `expanded`; default `free`).
   - Wire junto-creation and meeting-visibility limits to this user field instead of the per-junto tier.
   - Generate and apply an Alembic migration.

4. ~~**Align meeting visibility limits**~~ ✅ Resolved — canonical limits are **Free = 1, Standard = 3, Expanded = 5** (per-junto tier). Pricing page and `Junto._TIER_MEETING_LIMITS` are consistent.

### Should-Do Before Alpha (Not Hard Blockers)

5. **Upgrade banners / conversion prompts**
   - When a free user tries to create a second junto: show the "You've reached the Free tier limit" card (see `free-tier.md`).
   - When a user is on free tier and meeting history is truncated: show "N older meetings hidden. Upgrade to see them all."

6. **Export (CSV/PDF)**
   - Standard-tier feature. Not implemented. The Standard tier description on the pricing page lists it as included.
   - Minimum viable: add placeholder buttons that explain the feature is coming, rather than routing to a 404.

7. **Self-reporting commitments**
   - Standard-tier feature. Currently only the owner can edit commitments for any member.
   - Minimum viable: display a notice on the junto page explaining that self-reporting is a Standard feature.

8. **Custom discussion prompts**
   - Expanded-tier feature. Not implemented.

9. **`/auth/login` redirects to correct page after accept-invite**
   - Verify the invite-accept flow works end-to-end when the user is not yet signed in (redirect chain: invite link → OAuth → back to accept URL).

10. **Production deployment checklist**
    - PostgreSQL connection string with pgvector extension enabled.
    - `SECRET_KEY` set to a long random value (not the default `dev-secret`).
    - OAuth credentials (Google + GitHub) configured for the production domain.
    - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `VOYAGE_API_KEY` set for the chatbot to work.
    - `MAIL_SERVER` configured if invite emails are desired.
    - Run `alembic upgrade head` before starting the server.
    - Franklin corpus seeded into pgvector (`scripts/seed_franklin.py`).

### Nice-to-Have (Post-Alpha)

- Junto-creation limit banners on the homepage (disabled "Create Junto" button with upgrade prompt).
- Meeting-count cap enforcement (currently history is soft-limited by visibility; the Standard/Expanded hard cap on total meetings per junto is not enforced at write time).
- Annual pricing (`$49.99/yr`, `$99.99/yr`) — not implemented.
- Billing cancel / resume flow.
- Ben's Counsel chatbot add-on billing integration.
- Franklin's 13 Virtues tracker.
- Export to PDF (requires a PDF library not yet in dependencies).
- Voice mode for Ben's Counsel.
- Member attendance-rate statistics.
- Full-text search across meeting notes.
